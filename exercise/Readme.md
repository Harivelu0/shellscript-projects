htop. It's like a dashboard that gives you a real-time view of what's happening inside your computer.
htop shows:
Top: CPU and memory usage, as well as how long your computer has been running (uptime).
Middle: A list of all the running programs (processes).
Bottom: Options for interacting with htop.
